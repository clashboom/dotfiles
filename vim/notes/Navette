Navette
## Notes:
   • _Navette_ lives on as a brand name.
   • Composite industry as category
   • Technologies - no spray layup, no autoclaves, just wet layup and vacuum infusions.
   • Simple, friendly, usable.


## TODO:

   • Seperate URLs for each language domain.com/lang/content
   • Crosslink sites? Show norwegian link on english site? Use rel=canonical to crosslinks
   • <link rel="alternate" hreflang="en" href="http://example.com/en" />
   • must be on links to self language version as well. In english page to english link hreflang=”en”
   • Use rel=”alternate” hreflang=”x”
   • Use hreflang=”x-default” for pages where you select language or the site is redirecting users
   • Each page with its own description. Title short, description longer, up to a paragraph.
   • Add rel="canonical" to links that refer to the same content
   • Use 301 redirect for language swap handler, and rel="canonical" for links
   • Make two sitemaps - One nicely styled in columns, ul-lists, and another one in <code> or <pre> for nicely styled XML sitemap which is meant for googol. Then consider adding an XML sitemap link to the human page
   • Make a useful 404 page. Remove wildcard .* path handler. Do not allow crawlers to index invalid sites.
   • Check relevant keywords
   
   • Add unique title tags
   • Add proper alt tags to all images
   • Home title should describe business, meta tags as well
   • Rename images to something descriptive
   • Block paths like /th and others (email, change locales) with robots.txt 

   • Add image sitemap file

   • Translate all content from english to norwegian and vice versa.
   • Add proper imagery, use picturefill.
   • Add Terms & Conditions, Privacy Policy.
   • Logo redesign - themed around Marquise/Navette diamond cut, perhaps. Replace the font to something more suitable, if needed ???
   • Check h5bp or Corry Simons Boy boilerplate for crossdomain policy. Related files, too.
   • Add a live search, hide input field. See Unibox and Codrops for example. Make it work well.
   • Add URLs from Google Static Map API to the contact page

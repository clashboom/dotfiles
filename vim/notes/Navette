Navette
## Notes:
   • _Navette_ lives on as a brand name.
   • Composite industry as category
   • Technologies - no spray layup, no autoclaves, just wet layup and vacuum infusions.
   • Simple, friendly, usable.


## TODO:
   • Translate all content from english to norwegian and vice versa.
   • Create content for Amarok and Hilux hardtops, About page in both languages.
   • Add proper imagery, use picturefill for responsiveness.
   • Add back to top links on both - bottom of the page and one that shows up when user scrolls-up (see Google Keep for example).
   • Add Terms & Conditions, Privacy Policy.
   • Logo redesign - themed around Marquise/Navette diamond cut, perhaps. Replace the font to something more suitable, if needed ???
   • Check h5bp or Corry Simons Boy boilerplate for crossdomain policy. Related files, too.
   • Add a live search, hide input field. See Unibox and Codrops for example. Make it work well.
     For this proper data modeling is needed, otherwise maintenance of JSON file will be major PITA in the future.
   • Add URLs from Google Static Map API to the contact page
   • Dont show region restriction note to users with norwegian locale
